summary: "Using light as a probe: how plasma diagnostics reveal gas temperatures and nanoparticle formation."

When it comes to carbon nanotube (CNT) synthesis, we often talk about hydrocarbons and catalysts.  
But before CNTs ever start to grow, **catalyst nanoparticles (NPs)** must first form, and their size distribution sets the stage for yield and quality.  

Most studies rely on electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy after synthesis.  
The problem: these only tell us what came out, not what happened *inside the plasma*.  

‚úÖ The missing piece: a way to directly measure **gas temperatures and nanoparticle formation in situ**.

## The ICP Platform

To study this, we built a **miniature inductively coupled plasma (ICP)** system:

- A **1 mm iron wire** fed into a quartz tube.  
- A **9-turn copper RF coil (27.12 MHz)** sustaining the plasma.  
- A **gas mix of argon with trace nitrogen**.  
- Diagnostics combining **optical emission spectroscopy (OES)** and **aerosol analyzers (DMA + CPC)**.

This compact design let us measure plasma conditions (via light) and Fe nanoparticle size distributions (via CPC) simultaneously.

## Plasma Light as a Thermometer

OES provided gas temperatures by fitting rotational spectra of **N‚ÇÇ and OH**.  
Key findings:

- **Gas temperature rises with RF power**: N‚ÇÇ rotational spectra reached ~1200 K at 110 W and low flow.  
- **Flow rate matters**: lower flows increased residence time, raising temperatures, but also led to plasma instability.  
- **N‚ÇÇ is more reliable than OH**: OH(A) states often deviate from equilibrium, while N‚ÇÇ(C) tracks gas temperature closely.

## Plasma Fingerprints

Broadband emission spectra revealed the active species inside:

- **Fe I / Fe II lines** from evaporated and ionized iron.  
- **OH radical** from trace water impurities.  
- **Ar carrier gas lines**.  
- **N‚ÇÇ bands** spanning 280‚Äì500 nm.

*Figure 3. Broadband emission spectrum (190‚Äì900 nm). Iron, argon, OH, and N‚ÇÇ features are clearly identified.*

These fingerprints confirm the plasma actively vaporizes Fe and sustains a reactive environment for nanoparticle nucleation.

## Iron Nanoparticle Formation

Fe nanoparticles exiting the plasma were sized in real time:

- **Stable size range:** 3‚Äì7 nm across conditions.  
- **Monodisperse distributions:** log-normal PSDs at low power (80 W).  
- **Concentration trend:** NP counts dropped from ~\(10^8\) cm‚Åª¬≥ at 1.5 lpm to ~\(10^7\) cm‚Åª¬≥ at 2.0 lpm, due to shorter residence time.

## Why This Matters

This study shows that:

1. **Plasma gas temperature can be mapped directly from light.**  
2. **Fe nanoparticles form with the right sizes (3‚Äì7 nm) for CNT growth.**  
3. **Concentrations remain low**, making ICP a diagnostic tool, not a production reactor.  

In other words: ICP plasmas are a **controlled environment** to study nanoparticle formation, before scaling insights into FCCVD reactors.

## Looking Ahead

The next step is to combine this ICP platform with hydrocarbon feedstocks ‚Äî to directly observe the transition from **Fe NP ‚Üí CNT nucleation**.  
By pairing plasma diagnostics with nanoparticle analysis, we can finally start controlling CNT synthesis from the ground up.
